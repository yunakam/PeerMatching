Issues to be solved:

- Registration attributes too many.. how best insert all the data?
- Cant set "Arts&Humanities" as subject title because
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS xxx
  does not accept "&"
- Deal with inappropriate inputs
- How to store keyword to a table instead of exactly as the list shows
- How to store category name from number
- Allow multiple choice for search()
- Exclude oneself from the search result
- Partial matches should not overlap with perfect matches
- Allow "It does not matter" for search options



Additional tasks:
- Let user change password
- Allow multiple subjects for learning (the same user exist in different subject tables)
